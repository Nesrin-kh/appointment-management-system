# Project Approach

I enjoyed working on this project, especially implementing CAPTCHA as it was my first time using it. It was a great learning experience and a valuable new skill. However, one challenge I faced was that CAPTCHA made it harder to validate the registration page quickly, as it required additional steps for user verification.

I also,
Used React for dynamic UI with react-router-dom for navigation.

Used Context API for authentication management.

Integrated JWT-based authentication in the backend.

Used SQLite as a lightweight database.

Followed RESTful API principles.


# Pending Features

Email notifications for appointments.

Role-based access control for better security.

Improved UI with better styling and animations.

Advanced Analytics: Implement charts and graphs for admin dashboard analytics.

Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, or AWS).
